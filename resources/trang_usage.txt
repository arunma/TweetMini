Alright Guys, I am using Trang to generate XSD from XML.
 
Being a lazy guy, this is all i could come up with for the XSD writing.

Execute the following command from the exec directory where trang.jar is 

java -jar trang.jar ../resources/alert-config.xml alert-config.xsd

Dont forget to modify the alert element as unbounded

<xs:element ref="alert" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>


PS : I am generating the Java bean from this XSD through xmlbeans. Since this is 
occasional process, I am keeping this in the build.xml but NOT invoking it everytime
